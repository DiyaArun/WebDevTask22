Hello!
I'm Diya Arun. This is my submission for Web Development Task, Coding Week '22.
This repository contains 39 files, excluding this. They are:
-32 .html files, one home page, one about page and 30 for each product.
-3 .css files, one each for home, about and product pages.
-1 .js file, for search functionality.
-1 .txt file, contains the dummy data given.
-2 .jpeg files, one for a home-button and one a photo of myself for about.
I hope you like my webpage! I had lots of fun making it.
